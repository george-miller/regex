Usage
-----
The main interface of the program can be obtained by importing regex.py into another python program.  Note when using the interface that the compile function returns a result that must be passed to findall.  

Tests
-----
To run the tests, use ```python test.py```

The tests for the three subsystem each have their own test file, and the main test.py is a simple runner that runs every file.  If you want to add new files to be tested, add them to test.py and make sure they have a run method.
