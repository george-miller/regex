# REGEX

This repository is a collection of implementations of a regular expression compiler.

[The presentation I made about my python implementation.](documents/pressentation.pdf)

[The hosted version of this parser.](http://georgemyersmiller.com/regex/)

I originally made the python implementation as a final project for my Natural Language Processing class.  When I had finished that project, I had a great understanding of how a regular expression parser should be implemented.  Instead of letting this understanding rot, I now use it to learn new languages and practice languages that I already know.  In this way, it has become a great portal for practice.

## Disclaimer

The only fully functioning parser is currently implemented in Python.
