# REGEX

This repository is a collection of implementations of a regular expression compiler.  

I originally made the python implementation as a final project for my Natural Language Processing class.  When I had finished that project, I had a great understanding of how a regular expression parser show be implemented.  Instead of letting this understanding rot, I now use it to learn new languages and practice languages that I already know.  In this way, it has become a great portal for practice.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarentee that all the implementations in this repo will have fully functioning parsers (Except the python one).
